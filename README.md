A comprehensive collection of my personal projects, academic work, coding challenges, courses, and more from my Computer Science learning journey.
  
#### Why all in one place?
  - Centralized management
  - Knowledge retention and stabilization
  - Impression (less and less attention people have nowadays.)
  - Ease of sharing
  - Cleaner GitHub profile for official projects
