1=>copy "allInputs.sh" to input folder(input1.txt, input2.txt, ...) and run it.
now you have "combinedInputs.txt", copy that to where your program is.

2=>copy "runCode.sh" to where your program and "combinedInputs.txt" are and run it.
now you have "outPutOfcode.txt".

3=>copy "allOutputs.sh" to output folder(output1.txt, output2.txt, ...) and run it.
now you have "combinedOutputs.txt", copy that to where your program is.

4=>run compare where your "combinedInputs.txt" and "combinedOutputs.txt" are.
